# TUI

This repository contains Stata syntax for categorising time-updated insulin use via PBS data in Australia. 
I doubt this code is perfect, given how error-prone the PBS data is and how complicated some insulin regimens are, but it works for at least 99.9% of cases in the dataset I developed it on. 
If I make improvements I will publish updated versions of the code here.
